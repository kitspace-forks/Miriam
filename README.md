## Introduction

Miriam is an open-source instrument for isothermal amplification reactions. The assays Miriam was designed to execute are based on LAMP and Elisa protocols. Miriam is controlled with [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) Mega and the production costs per instrument are blow 200USD.

Miriam is optimized for the Syto 9 fluorescent intercalating DNA dye. (The original design was for [calcein dye](http://loopamp.eiken.co.jp/e/products/fluore/index.html). The selected LED is an angle SMD led with peak wavelength 461nm. The photodiode is an RGB photodiode most sensitive to green light. The optics also include an emission filter utilized in theatrical lighting.  The development and selection of components is further described in a [Master's thesis](http://lutpub.lut.fi/handle/10024/159386) done from miriam.

**Figure 1.** LAMP reaction in 96 well plate. The reaction was performed in the center and corners of the 96 well plate to test heat uniformity.

In the performance testing of Miriam, the detection limit for DNA using LAMP as amplification platform has been 2amol in 10ul of sample (figure 1).

If you're interested in modifying or extending the Miriam platform, we strongly suggest you to send us an email discussing your ideas. That way you can coordinate with our team and others, giving your work a higher chance of being integrated into the official release.

## Design

The optics of Miriam plus are designed to support Syto9 + DNA. The emission and absorption spectra of Syto9 + DNA are represented in Figure 3.

LEE filter 738 is used for blocking the excitation light. Whole optic design of Miriam plus is shown in Figure 4.

The middle heating board and the LED and PD arrangements have been designed to support 96-well plates with the following dimensions (figure 5).

**Figure 5.** 96-well plate dimensions supported by Miriam

To control the heating of Miriam there are two heater PCBs. They have been designed so that in the middle is a 10 kohm SMD thermistor and the heat is generated by current flowing through the copper traces. These traces have been designed to be so long and narrow that they create an internal resistance of few ohms. The traces are closer to each other in the edges because heat is measured from the middle and the edges of the PCB boards meet ambient air and they need to produce more heat. (Figure 6.)

**Figure 5.** Heating plates, heat is generated by trace resistance. Right: The middle heater creating the temperature required for amplification (58-68 degrees C). Left: The top heater keeping vapor from condensing to the lid, kept at 80 degrees C.

**Figure 5a.** The distribution of heat in the FR4 and Al heaters. FR4 heaters may work with small number of wells setup. For Miriam, we recommend using Al boards for better heat distribution.

The detection of fluorescence is done with 96 LEDs and 96 photodiodes creating LED and photodiode PCBs. The LED peak wavelength is 470 nm and photodiode is a green RGB photodiode. The measured voltage is amplified with an operational amplifier to 0-5 V that is then converted by Arduinoâ€™s 8-bit ADC to be a numerical value. (figure 6.)

All of these boards are controlled by a shield that is directly mounted to the Arduino mega board (figure 7). The shield contains three MOSFETs to control LED board and the two heater boards, the required components to read the heat from the thermistors as well as a WIFI chip. The WIFI chip makes it possible for Arduino to be connected to a local WIFI and this way communicate autonomously to a web service.

Installation
------------
3D print the printable parts under folder "3D model", sand them to make them align with each other. Assemble the boards as presented in the Figure 8. In the assembly cut with scissors the emission filter to fit between the LED and the sensor PCBs so that it aligns with the bolts.

**Figure 8.** PCB board assembly information.

The wiring problem of original sensor board has been fixed in this new version.

**Note:** All the cables used for Miriam must be "Opposite Side Contacts".

**Updated components:** The new [BOM list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jToRLCrUTaD4QrNjGMmmIuaWwqO89PiL6eRc0J-1mlM/edit?usp=sharing) of the Covid-19 adapted Miriam will be updated constantly during our test.

The original Miriam is an open source project, supported by Miroculus in collaboration with Arduino (Sweden). The team was led by Juho Terrijarvi.

This version of Miriam has been improved by [Straw Lab](https://strawlab.org) to make it work with Syto-9 + DNA for potentially Covid-19 test.
